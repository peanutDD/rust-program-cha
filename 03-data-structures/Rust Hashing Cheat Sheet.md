Hashing is the process of transforming arbitrary data into a fixed-size number. Several useful programming concepts arise out of hash codes:

* Hash sets and maps
* Data digests
* Cheap identifiers / inequality checks
* Storing passwords

Recently I tried writing a hash set from scratch in [Rust](https://rust-lang.org/) for educational purposes, but was awfully confused by the collection of traits and types provided by [`std::hash`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/hash/index.html). In this post I hope to share some common patterns related to hashing in Rust, while explaining `std::hash` as I go.

## Hashing a Single Value

Hashing a value is as simple as creating a `Hasher`, calling `value.hash(&mut hasher)`, and then calling `hasher.finish()`.

    use std::hash::{DefaultHasher, Hash, Hasher};

    let mut hasher = DefaultHasher::new();
    "Hello, world!".hash(&mut hasher);
    let hash: u64 = hasher.finish();

    println!("Hash: {hash}"); // Hash: 7092736762612737980

## Hashing Several Values into One Code

You can call `value.hash(&mut hasher)` several times to create a hash code composed of multiple data sources. This is useful when hashing structs or arrays.

    use std::hash::{DefaultHasher, Hash, Hasher};

    let mut hasher = DefaultHasher::new();

    "Hello".hash(&mut hasher);
    13u64.hash(&mut hasher);
    false.hash(&mut hasher);

    let hash: u64 = hasher.finish();

    println!("Hash: {hash}"); // Hash: 3402450879032501501

## `Hash`, `Hasher`, and `DefaultHasher`

* [`Hash`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/hash/trait.Hash.html): a type that can be hashed (`str`, `u64`, `bool`, etc.)
* [`Hasher`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/hash/trait.Hasher.html): a hashing algorithm (`DefaultHasher`, 3rd-party implementations)
* [`DefaultHasher`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/hash/struct.DefaultHasher.html): Rust's default hashing algorithm^1^

`Hasher`s are never re-used to make several hash codes. If you want to compute a new hash code, you discard the current `Hasher` and create a new one.

## Hashing with a Random Seed

To make a hash resilient to [hash flooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_attack#Hash_flooding), you can create a `Hasher` with a random seed using `RandomState`.

    use std::hash::{BuildHasher, Hash, Hasher, RandomState};

    let state = RandomState::new();

    let mut hasher = state.build_hasher();
    "Hello, world!".hash(&mut hasher);
    let hash = hasher.finish();

    println!("Hash: {hash}"); // Hash: 1905042730872565693

There's also a shorthand for this pattern using [`BuildHasher::hash_one()`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/hash/trait.BuildHasher.html#method.hash_one).

    use std::hash::{BuildHasher, RandomState};

    let state = RandomState::new();

    let hash = state.hash_one("Hello, world!");

    println!("Hash: {hash}"); // Hash: 11506452463443521132

Note how the hash codes are different from the two examples, even though they're both hashing `"Hello, world!"`, because `RandomState::new()` creates a new random seed each time it is called.

## `BuildHasher` and `RandomSeed`

* [`BuildHasher`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/hash/trait.BuildHasher.html): a type that can create a new `Hasher` with a seed
* [`RandomState`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/hash/struct.RandomState.html): generates a random seed when constructed, then builds `Hasher`s using that seed

If you want to hash two separate values and compare them for equality, you would typically create one `RandomState` then use it to build two `DefaultHasher`s with the same seed.^2^

## Deriving `Hash`

The easiest way to make a custom type hashable is by deriving `Hash`.

    use std::hash::{DefaultHasher, Hash, Hasher};

    #[derive(Hash)]
    struct Foo {
        a: &'static str,
        b: u64,
        c: bool,
    }

    let mut hasher = DefaultHasher::new();

    Foo { a: "Hello", b: 13, c: false }.hash(&mut hasher);

    let hash: u64 = hasher.finish();

    println!("Hash: {hash}"); // Hash: 3402450879032501501

## Implementing `Hash` Manually

If you look closely, you'll notice that the hash codes from [Hashing Several Values into One Code](https://bd103.github.io/blog/2025-11-10-rust-hashing-cheat-sheet/#hashing-several-values-into-one-code) and [Deriving `Hash`](https://bd103.github.io/blog/2025-11-10-rust-hashing-cheat-sheet/#deriving-hash) are equal! This is because they're hashing the same data in the same order with the same seed. To prove this, we can expand the `Hash` derivation:

    use std::hash::{Hash, Hasher};

    struct Foo {
        a: &'static str,
        b: u64,
        c: bool,
    }

    impl Hash for Foo {
        fn hash<H: Hasher>(&self, state: &mut H) {  self.a.hash(state);  self.b.hash(state);  self.c.hash(state);  }
    }

## Conclusion

I hope these examples help you wrap your head around Rust's hashing support! While I didn't cover it in this article, you may be also interested in [`Hasher`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/hash/trait.Hasher.html)'s methods and how primitives like [`bool`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/hash/trait.Hash.html#impl-Hash-for-bool), [`char`](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/hash/trait.Hash.html#impl-Hash-for-char), and [tuples](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/hash/trait.Hash.html#impl-Hash-for-(T,)) implement `Hash`. You may also enjoy looking at [`rustc-hash`](https://lib.rs/crates/rustc-hash) (previous `fxhash`), [`fnv`](https://lib.rs/crates/fnv), [`sha2`](https://lib.rs/crates/sha2), and [`blake2`](https://lib.rs/crates/blake2).

Happy hacking!

1. In Rust 1.91.0 the default hashing algorithm is [SipHash 1-3](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SipHash), but this is an internal detail that may change in the future. ↩

2. Technically, you could just create the two hashers by calling `DefaultHasher::new()`, which initializes them with a seed of 0. This is vulnerable to [hash flooding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collision_attack#Hash_flooding) attacks, however, so I don't recommend it! ↩
